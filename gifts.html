	<h2>Gifts</h2>
	<p>Woodside Farm Creamery has $1 and $2 tokens available for purchase through the ice cream stand. These are ideal for handing out in appreciation of a task well done or in thanking someone for their help, support, or simply being there in a time of need. Purchase as few or as many as you require. Remember that tokens are great to hand out at Halloween, easy to slip in a birthday or anniversary gift box, and make excellent holiday stocking stuffers!</p>
	<p>Woodside Farm Creamery tokens spend the same as cash and are accepted at our ice cream stand or at any special event where you see the Woodside Farm Creamery trailer serving ice cream. Tokens may be redeemed against the total purchase of ice cream products offered by Woodside Farm Creamery.</p>
	<p><strong>For those wishing for gift certificates, Woodside Farm Creamery has certificates available in $5 and $10 amounts.</strong></p>
