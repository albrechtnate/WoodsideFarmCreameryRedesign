	<h4>Instructions for Slicing</h4>
	<p><strong>You’ll need:</strong> Long bladed knife and a tall glass of hot/warm water.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>40–45 minutes (30 minutes for a 6-inch cake) before slicing and serving your ice cream cake, transfer the cake from the freezer to the refrigerator. (This will soften the ice cream enough to be able to cut through.)</li>
		<li>Place the knife in the glass of warm water to heat up the blade.</li>
		<li>When ready to slice and serve, remove the cake from the fridge and slice down the center of the cake. *You may need to press firmly all the way down through the two layers on the first knife insertion, pull the knife straight up and back out, and then continue across the cake in sections, to make sure you slice through the entire cake.</li>
		<li>As you slice, you’ll need to clean off your knife in the glass of warm water making sure you wip off the excess water.</li>
		<li>Top each slice with a little whipped cream, and enjoy!</li>
	</ol>
